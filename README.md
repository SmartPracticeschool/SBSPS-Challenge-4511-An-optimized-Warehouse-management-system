#IBM gRPC
Please refer to the IBM_gRPC folder for multiprocessing/network traffic handling & aerospike parts.
We have used aerosike DB, used by many modern day companies and also gRPC protocol over HTTP which ensures data security of sensible data.
Both aerospike and gRPC combined together provide many advantages.
Screenshots can be also referred to, which are present in the folder so proof of concept .
Separate Readme files are present to execute the project
